### Keyword spotting with african languages
Keyword spotting refers to the task of learning to detect spoken keywords. It interfaces all modern voice-based virtual assistants on the market: Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and the Google Home device. Contrarily to speech recognition models, keyword spotting doesn’t run on the cloud, but directly on the device. This sets up a natural constraint on the model size, energy consumption, and compute efficiency of the model because often the hardware devices have limited memory and limited computing power. The prerequisite to perform such a task with African languages would be the creation of a dedicated dataset. Indeed, African languages account for 30.15% of the 7111 living languages (Orife et al. 2020), which provide great diversity. Unfortunately, they are barely represented in natural language processing (NLP) research.
